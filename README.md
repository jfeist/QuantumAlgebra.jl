# NOTE: This package is currently undergoing a major rewrite
The new version is in branch 
[full_rewrite](https://github.com/jfeist/QuantumAlgebra.jl/tree/full_rewrite), 
and apart from updated examples and documentation is mostly stable and 
well-tested by now. New users are encouraged to try that out. The biggest user-facing 
change is that normal/canonical form is not enforced automatically, but has to be
explicitly calculated (with `normal_form(x)`).

This package does quantum operator algebra (i.e., algebra with non-commuting
operators) in Julia. It defines an opinionated canonical form (normal ordering
plus some additional rules) that all expressions are automatically transformed
to, which fulfills some invariants that then allows easy use of the resulting
expressions. It is recommended to use an interface that can display LaTeX
formulas (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) for convenient output formatting.

While there is some documentation, it is not always kept fully up to date, and
it is recommended to look at the latest commit messages to get an idea about new
features etc. You can also check out the notebooks in the `examples` folder, which
can be viewed online with
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jfeist/QuantumAlgebra.jl/blob/master/examples/)
and even tried out interactively with
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jfeist/QuantumAlgebra.jl/master?filepath=examples).

## Overview

We define an abstract type that represents an operator, and some concrete subtypes to describe various operators. We have:
- `scal(x)` representing a scalar _x_
- `param(g,(i,j),state='n')` representing a named scalar parameter _g<sub>i,j</sub>_. `state` can be `'r'` for purely real parameters (invariant under complex conjugation), `'n'` for not-conjugated values, and `'c'` for a conjugated parameter _g<sub>i,j</sub><sup>*</sup>_.
- `a(i)` and `adag(i)` representing _a<sub>i</sub>_ and _a<sub>i</sub><sup>†</sup>_, the annihilation and creation operators for bosonic mode _i_
- `f(i)` and `fdag(i)` representing _f<sub>i</sub>_ and _f<sub>i</sub><sup>†</sup>_, the annihilation and creation operators for fermionic mode _i_
- `σ(a,i)` representing the Pauli matrix _σ<sub>a,i</sub>_ for two-level system (TLS) _i_, where _a ∈ {x=1,y=2,z=3}_ is the type of Pauli matrix.
- `OpProd(A,B)` representing _A B_, i.e., the product of two operators
- `OpSum(A,B)` representing _A + B_, i.e., the sum of two operators
- `OpSumAnalytical(i,A)` or `∑(i,A)` representing _∑<sub>i</sub> A_, i.e., an analytical sum over an index (assumed to run over all possible values of _i_).
- `ExpVal(A)` representing the expectation value ⟨_A_⟩
- `Corr(AB)` representing the correlation ⟨_AB_⟩<sub>c</sub> = ⟨_AB_⟩ - ⟨_A_⟩⟨_B_⟩, with corresponding extensions for products of more operators.

All operations are defined in such a way that the finally created object is automatically transformed to "canonical" form, which is defined by the following:
- Operator sums are expanded fully, such that the final expression is always a sum of operator products. I.e., if we write _(A + B)(C + D)_, we get _AC + AD + BC + BD_.
- Operator products are expressed in a well-defined "canonical" order. To achieve this canonical form, relevant commutators etc are used, so that an expression written as a single product can turn into a sum of expressions.
    1. at most one scalar prefactor (i.e., all prefactors collapsed into one)
    1. parameters ordered alphabetically (by string comparison)
    1. expectation values ⟨_A_⟩
    1. many-body correlations ⟨_AB_⟩<sub>c</sub>
    1. bosonic operators in normal ordering (i.e., first creation, then annihilation operators), ordered by mode index
    1. fermionic operators in normal ordering (i.e., first creation, then annihilation operators), ordered by mode index
    1. Two-level Pauli matrices, ordered by TLS mode index. At most one Pauli matrix per TLS
- Operator sums are ordered first by number of operators (both bare and within expectation values and correlations), and then with the same priority rules.

Some other useful functions that are implemented:
- `comm(A,B)`: calculates the commutator of arbitrary operators [_A,B_] = _AB - BA_. This allows, e.g., to calculate Heisenberg equations of motion for the operators.
- `ascorr(x)` takes an expression `x=A B C + D E...` and writes its expectation value in terms of single-body expectation values ⟨_A_⟩, ⟨_B_⟩, ..., and many-body correlations ⟨_AB_⟩<sub>c</sub>, ⟨_ABC_⟩<sub>c</sub>, etc. Currently, up to fourth-order correlations (i.e., products of four operators) are supported.
- `Avac(A)` and `vacA(A)` simplify operators by assuming they are applied to the vacuum from the left or right, respectively. To be precise, `Avac(A)` returns _A'_ such that _A_|0⟩ = _A'_|0⟩, while `vacA(A)` does the same for ⟨0|_A_.
- `vacExpVal(A,S=1)` calculates the vacuum expectation value ⟨0|_S<sup>†</sup>AS_|0⟩, i.e., the expectation value ⟨ψ|_A_|ψ⟩ for the state defined by |ψ⟩=_S_|0⟩.
