It is recommended to use an interface that can display LaTeX formulas (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) for convenient output formatting. While there is some documentation, it is not always kept fully up to date, and it is recommended to look at the latest commit messages to get an idea about new features etc. You can also check out the notebooks in the examples folder, which can be viewed online with nbviewer and tried out interactively with Binder.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Updates-in-v1.0.0","page":"Home","title":"Updates in v1.0.0","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This is a major revision with some breaking changes.

In order to transform expressions to normal form, use normal_form(x).

Note that for a single operator, A_c = A, but we distinguish the two formally for clarity.\nThere is a new function julia_expression(A) that converts a QuantumAlgebra object to a julia expression, which helps in using QuantumAlgebra to programatically derive codes for numerical implementation.

For fermions, this is not always desired, since you might want to use different named operators to refer to different kinds of states for the same species (e.g., localized and itinerant electrons). This can be achieved with the macro @anticommuting_fermion_group, which creates several fermionic operators that mutually anticommute:\njulia> @anticommuting_fermion_group c d\n\njulia> normal_form(c()*d() + d()*c())\n0\nparam(name::Symbol,state='n',inds...) to create a named parameter. state must be one of 'r', 'n', or 'c' for purely real, non-conjugated complex, and conjugated complex parameters.

To achieve this canonical form, relevant commutators etc are used, so an expression written as a single product can turn into a sum of expressions. The order is essentially normal ordering (creation before annihilation operators, with σˣʸᶻ in the middle), with some additional conventions to make the normal form (hopefully) unique. In some contexts (e.g., interactive work), it can be convenient to automatically transform all expressions to normal form. This can be enabled by calling QuantumAlgebra.auto_normal_form(true), or alternatively by setting the environment variable QUANTUMALGEBRA_AUTO_NORMAL_FORM to \"true\" (or any value that parse(Bool,value) parses as true) before using QuantumAlgebra.\njulia> normal_form(a(:i)*adag(:j))\nδ(ij)  + a†(j) a(i)\nexpval(A::QuExpr) to represent an expectation value.\njulia> expval(adag(:j)*a(:i))\n⟨a†(j) a(i)⟩\nexpval_as_corrs(A::QuExpr) to represent an expectation value through its correlators, i.e., a cumulant expansion.\njulia> expval_as_corrs(adag(:j)*a(:i))\n⟨a†(j)⟩c ⟨a(i)⟩c  + ⟨a†(j) a(i)⟩c\ncomm(A::QuExpr,B::QuExpr) to calculate the commutator AB = AB - BA.\njulia> comm(a(),adag())\n-a†() a() + a() a†()\n\njulia> normal_form(comm(a(),adag()))\n1\nAvac(A) and vacA(A) simplify operators by assuming they are applied to the vacuum from the left or right, respectively. To be precise, Avac(A) returns A such that A0 = A0, while vacA(A) does the same for 0A. These functions automatically apply normal_form to assure that the operators are simplified as much as possible. Note that \"vacuum\" for two-level systems is interpreted as the lower state, σ^z0 = -0.\njulia> Avac(a())\n0\n\njulia> Avac(a(:i)*adag(:j))\nδ(ij)\n\njulia> Avac(a()*adag()*adag())\n2 a†()\n\njulia> vacA(a()*adag()*adag())\n0\n\njulia> Avac(σx())\nσˣ()\n\njulia> Avac(σz())\n-1\nvacExpVal(A,S=1) calculates the vacuum expectation value 0S^AS0, i.e., the expectation value ψAψ for the state defined by ψ=S0.

Every expectation value or correlator is treated as a separate array. Daggers are represented as ᴴ, which are valid identifiers that can appear in the array names.
