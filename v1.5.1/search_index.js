Typically, these equation systems are not closed without approximations as equations for products of n operators involve products of m>n operators, so the system has to be truncated. This is achieved with a filter function that removes higher-order terms or rewrites them (approximately) in terms of lower-order expressions. Simple example:\njulia> using QuantumAlgebra\njulia> @boson_ops a;\njulia> H = Pr\"ω\"*a'()*a() + Pr\"χ\"*a'()*(a'()+a())*a();\njulia> Ls = ((Pr\"γ\",a()),);\njulia> EQ = heisenberg_eom_system(H,2,Ls,a())\ndₜ⟨a()⟩ = -1//2 γ ⟨a()⟩  - 1i ω ⟨a()⟩  - 2i χ ⟨a†() a()⟩  - 1i χ ⟨a()²⟩ \ndₜ⟨a†() a()⟩ = -γ ⟨a†() a()⟩ \ndₜ⟨a()²⟩ = -2i χ ⟨a()⟩  - γ ⟨a()²⟩  - 2i ω ⟨a()²⟩  \nAdd additional argument modes_in_vacuum to vacA, Avac, and vacExpVal, to restrict the modes that are considered to be in the vacuum state, with all other operators unaffected.\nFix a LaTeX output error where Latexify misinterpreted a superscript \"^+\" as a sum and replaced \"x^+ - y\" with \"x^- y\".","category":"page"},{"location":"release_notes/#v1.4.0-(2024-06-29)","page":"Release notes","title":"v1.4.0 (2024-06-29)","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"release_notes/","page":"Release notes","title":"Release notes","text":"This is a minor release with some bug fixes and new features:","category":"page"},{"location":"release_notes/","page":"Release notes","title":"Release notes","text":"Allow Number type inputs for most exported functions so that they do not require QuExpr wrapping, such that expval(3) or Avac(1) no longer raise errors (closes #14).\nSupport interoperability with symbolic computer algebra systems (CAS) such as Symbolics.jl or SymPy.jl / SymPyPythonCall.jl.

In some contexts (e.g., interactive work), it can be convenient to automatically transform all expressions to normal form. This can be enabled by calling QuantumAlgebra.auto_normal_form(true).

To be precise, Avac(A) returns A such that A0 = A0, while vacA(A) does the same for 0A. These functions automatically apply normal_form to assure that the operators are simplified as much as possible. Note that \"vacuum\" for two-level systems is interpreted as the lower state, σ^z0 = -0.\njulia> Avac(a())\n0\n\njulia> Avac(a(:i)*a'(:j))\nδ(ij)\n\njulia> Avac(a()*a'()*a'())\n2 a†()\n\njulia> vacA(a()*a'()*a'())\n0\n\njulia> Avac(σx())\nσˣ()\n\njulia> Avac(σz())\n-1\nBoth functions can also be called with an optional second argument, Avac(A,modes_in_vacuum) or vacA(A,modes_in_vacuum), which is an iterable over operators (or a single operator) that will be assumed to be in the vacuum state, while all others are not. Note that the operators in modes_in_vacuum do not distinguish by index, i.e., if the modes have indices, all modes with the same name are assumed to be in the vacuum state. To avoid confusion, the modes_in_vacuum argument thus does not accept operators with indices.\njulia> Avac(a(),a())\n0\n\njulia> Avac(a(),f())\na()\n\njulia> Avac(a(:i)*a'(:j),f())\nδ(ij)  + a†(j) a(i)\n\njulia> Avac(a'()*a()*f()*f'(),f())\na†() a()\n\njulia> @boson_ops b;\n\njulia> Avac(a'()*a()*b()*b'()^2*f()*f'(),(f(),b()))\n2 a†() b†() a()\nvacExpVal(A,S=1) calculates the vacuum expectation value 0S^AS0, i.e., the expectation value ψAψ for the state defined by ψ=S0. The result is guaranteed to not contain any operators.\njulia> vacExpVal(a'()*a())\n0\n\njulia> vacExpVal(a'()*a(), a'()^4/sqrt(factorial(4)))\n4\n\njulia> vacExpVal(a'()*a(), a'()^4/sqrt(factorial(big(4))))\n4\n\njulia> vacExpVal(σx())\n0\nLike vacA and Avac, vacExpVal also takes an optional modes_in_vacuum argument, vacExpVal(A,S,modes_in_vacuum) (since all arguments are positional, S has to be given explicitly in this case even if it is just the identity operator, i.e., vacExpVal(A,1,a())):\njulia> @boson_ops b;\n\njulia> vacExpVal(a'()*a()*b()^2*b'()^2*f()*f'(), 1, (f(),b()))\n2 a†() a()\nheisenberg_eom(A,H,Ls=()) calculates the Heisenberg equation of motion for operator A under the action of Hamiltonian H and potential Lindblad decay terms Ls, given by fracdAdt = iHA + _i γ_i (L_i^ A L_i - frac12 L_i^ L_iA). The Lindblad decay operators are passed as a tuple (not an array) of tuples, where each inner tuple describes one decay operator. The possible forms are (L,) for decay operator L, (γ,L) for decay operator L with rate γ, and (inds,γ,L) for decay operators summed over the given indices (note that this is different from the operator itself being a sum, seen in the example below). Finally, L can (in all three cases above) be just a single operator or a tuple of two operators L=(X,Y) to represent off-diagonal Lindblad terms L_XYρ = X ρ Y^ - frac12 Y^ Xρ.\njulia> H = Pr\"ω\"*a'()a();\n\njulia> Ls = ((Pr\"γ\",a()),);\n\njulia> normal_form(heisenberg_eom(a(),H,Ls))\n-1//2 γ a() - 1i ω a()\n\njulia> H = QuExpr();\n\njulia> Ls = ((:i,a(:i)),);\n\njulia> normal_form(heisenberg_eom(a(:i),H,Ls))\n-1//2 a(i)\n\njulia> Ls = ((∑(:i,a(:i)),),);\n\njulia> normal_form(heisenberg_eom(a(:i),H,Ls))\n-1//2 ∑₁ a(#₁)\n\njulia> Ls = (((:i,:j),(a(:i),a(:j))),);\n\njulia> normal_form(heisenberg_eom(a(:i),H,Ls))\n-1//2 ∑₁ a(#₁)\nheisenberg_eom_system(H,rhsfilt,Ls=(),ops=nothing) calculates the system of equations of motion for the expectation values of operators appearing in H and Ls (same conventions as for heisenberg_eom above). Typically, these equation systems are not closed without approximations as equations for products of n operators involve products of mn operators, so the system has to be truncated. This is achieved with a filter function that removes higher-order terms or rewrites them (approximately) in terms of lower-order expressions. The function rhsfilt is applied to the right-hand side of the equations to filter them as desired. If rhsfilt(A::QuExpr)::QuExpr is a function, it will be applied to the calculated right-hand side of the equations. QuantumAlgebra comes with two predefined constructors for filter functions, droplen(maxorder::Int), which leads to all terms of order higher than maxorder being neglected, and dropcorr(maxorder::Int), where all terms of order higher than maxorder are rewritten in terms of lower-order expressions up to order maxorder and higher-order correlators, with those correlations being neglected (i.e., dropcorr(1) will replace a^ a = a^ a_c + a^ a  a^ a). If rhsfilt is a number, it will be interpreted as droplen(rhsfilt). Finally, the ops argument can be used to specify the operators that should be used to \"seed\" the system of equations, otherwise all operators appearing in H are used.\njulia> H = Pr\"ω\"*a'()*a() + Pr\"χ\"*a'()*(a'()+a())*a();\n\njulia> Ls = ((Pr\"γ\",a()),);\n\njulia> heisenberg_eom_system(H,2,Ls,a())\ndₜ⟨a()⟩ = -1//2 γ ⟨a()⟩  - 1i ω ⟨a()⟩  - 2i χ ⟨a†() a()⟩  - 1i χ ⟨a()²⟩ \ndₜ⟨a†() a()⟩ = -γ ⟨a†() a()⟩ \ndₜ⟨a()²⟩ = -2i χ ⟨a()⟩  - γ ⟨a()²⟩  - 2i ω ⟨a()²⟩  \nThe heisenberg_eom_system function can also be passed either ExpVal or Corr as a first argument, which will give the equations of motion of the expectation values (the default) or correlators (corresponding to a cumulant expansion) of the operators.\njulia> H = Pr\"ω\"*a'()*a() + Pr\"χ\"*a'()*(a'()+a())*a();\n\njulia> Ls = ((Pr\"γ\",a()),);\n\njulia> heisenberg_eom_system(Corr,H,1,Ls,a())\ndₜ⟨a()⟩c = -1//2 γ ⟨a()⟩c  - 1i ω ⟨a()⟩c  - 2i χ ⟨a†()⟩c ⟨a()⟩c  - 1i χ ⟨a()⟩c² \njulia_expression(A) to obtain a julia expression that can be used to automatically build codes implementing equations derived with QuantumAlgebra. Every expectation value or correlator is treated as a separate array. Daggers are represented as ᴴ, which are valid identifiers that can appear in the array names. Note that expectation values and correlators are not distinguished, so it is best to have all expressions use the same kind.\njulia> julia_expression(expval_as_corrs(a'(:j)*a(:i)))\n:(aᴴ[j] * a[i] + aᴴa[j, i])\nAlso note that expressions are always treated as arrays, even if they have no indices (which gives zero-dimensional arrays). If you are working with scalar quantities exclusively, it might be useful to clean up the resulting expression (e.g., use MacroTools to remove the []).\njulia> julia_expression(expval(a'()*a()*σx()))\n:(aᴴaσˣ[])\nBy default, two-level system operators are represented by the Pauli matrices σ^xyz, and calling σp() and σm() will give results expressed through them:\njulia> σp()\n1//2 σˣ() + 1//2i σʸ()\n\njulia> σm()\n1//2 σˣ() - 1//2i σʸ()\nThis can be changed by calling QuantumAlgebra.use_σpm(true; set_preference=true/false) (where the value of set_preference determines whether this is stored permanently using Preferences.jl).
