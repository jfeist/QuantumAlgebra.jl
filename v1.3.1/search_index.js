It is recommended to use an interface that can display LaTeX formulas (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) for convenient output formatting.

These will be removed in a future version, as $(name)'() is now the preferred syntax for creating an adjoint.\njulia> @boson_ops b\n(b (QuExpr constructor), b† (QuExpr constructor))\n\njulia> b'(:k)*b(:i)\nb†(k) b(i)\nOperators with different names are assumed to belong to different \"species\" and always commute. For fermions, this is not always desired, since you might want to use different named operators to refer to different kinds of states for the same species (e.g., localized and itinerant electrons). This can be achieved with the macro @anticommuting_fermion_group, which creates several fermionic operators that mutually anticommute:\njulia> @anticommuting_fermion_group c d\n\njulia> normal_form(c()*d() + d()*c())\n0\nparam(name::Symbol,state='n',inds...) to create a named parameter. state must be one of 'r', 'n', or 'c' for purely real, non-conjugated complex, and conjugated complex parameters. More conveniently, parameters can be entered with string macros Pr\"name_inds...\" and Pc\"name_inds...\" for real and complex parameters:\njulia> Pr\"g_i,j_2,k\"\ng(ij₂k)\n\njulia> Pr\"g_i,j_2,k\" == param(:g,'r',:i,:j_2,:k)\ntrue\n\njulia> Pc\"α_3\" == param(:α,3)\ntrue\nArithmetic operations (*, +, -, ^, adjoint=') are supported (exponents must be nonnegative integers), with any Number types integrating automatically. Division by numbers is also supported.\njulia> 5*a'(:k)*f(3)*σx(3)\n5 a†(k) f(3) σˣ(3)\n\njulia> (5//3+4im) * a'(:k)*f(3)*σx(3) + 9.4\n9.4 + (5//3+4i) a†(k) f(3) σˣ(3)\n\njulia> (a(:i)*f(:k))'\nf†(k) a†(i)\nIf you need a bare number as a QuantumAlgebra expression, you can use x*one(QuExpr) (or one(A), where A is any QuExpr).\n∑(ind,A::QuExpr) to represent an analytic sum over index ind. Since summed indices have no semantic meaning, the index within the expression gets replaced by a special numbered sum index #ᵢ, with i=1,2,....\njulia> ∑(:i,a(:i))\n∑₁ a(#₁)\nnormal_form(A::QuExpr) converts an expression to a well-defined \"canonical\" order. To achieve this canonical form, relevant commutators etc are used, so an expression written as a single product can turn into a sum of expressions. The order is essentially normal ordering (creation before annihilation operators, with σˣʸᶻ in the middle), with some additional conventions to make the normal form (hopefully) unique. In some contexts (e.g., interactive work), it can be convenient to automatically transform all expressions to normal form. This can be enabled by calling QuantumAlgebra.auto_normal_form(true). To make the setting permanent, call QuantumAlgebra.auto_normal_form(true; set_preference=true) or alternatively use Preferences.jl directly, i.e., call Preferences.set_preferences!(QuantumAlgebra,\"auto_normal_form\"=>true/false).\njulia> normal_form(a(:i)*a'(:j))\nδ(ij)  + a†(j) a(i)\nexpval(A::QuExpr) to represent an expectation value.\njulia> expval(a'(:j)*a(:i))\n⟨a†(j) a(i)⟩\nexpval_as_corrs(A::QuExpr) to represent an expectation value through its correlators, i.e., a cumulant expansion.\njulia> expval_as_corrs(a'(:j)*a(:i))\n⟨a†(j)⟩c ⟨a(i)⟩c  + ⟨a†(j) a(i)⟩c\ncomm(A::QuExpr,B::QuExpr) to calculate the commutator AB = AB - BA.\njulia> comm(a(),a'())\n-a†() a() + a() a†()\n\njulia> normal_form(comm(a(),a'()))\n1\nAvac(A) and vacA(A) simplify operators by assuming they are applied to the vacuum from the left or right, respectively. To be precise, Avac(A) returns A such that A0 = A0, while vacA(A) does the same for 0A. These functions automatically apply normal_form to assure that the operators are simplified as much as possible. Note that \"vacuum\" for two-level systems is interpreted as the lower state, σ^z0 = -0.\njulia> Avac(a())\n0\n\njulia> Avac(a(:i)*a'(:j))\nδ(ij)\n\njulia> Avac(a()*a'()*a'())\n2 a†()\n\njulia> vacA(a()*a'()*a'())\n0\n\njulia> Avac(σx())\nσˣ()\n\njulia> Avac(σz())\n-1\nvacExpVal(A,S=1) calculates the vacuum expectation value 0S^AS0, i.e., the expectation value ψAψ for the state defined by ψ=S0. The result is guaranteed to not contain any operators.\njulia> vacExpVal(a'()*a())\n0\n\njulia> vacExpVal(a'()*a(), a'()^4/sqrt(factorial(4)))\n4.000000000000001\n\njulia> vacExpVal(a'()*a(), a'()^4/sqrt(factorial(big(4))))\n4\n\njulia> vacExpVal(σx())\n0\njulia_expression(A) to obtain a julia expression that can be used to automatically build codes implementing equations derived with QuantumAlgebra. Every expectation value or correlator is treated as a separate array. Daggers are represented as ᴴ, which are valid identifiers that can appear in the array names. Note that expectation values and correlators are not distinguished, so it is best to have all expressions use the same kind.\njulia> julia_expression(expval_as_corrs(a'(:j)*a(:i)))\n:(aᴴ[j] * a[i] + aᴴa[j, i])\nAlso note that expressions are always treated as arrays, even if they have no indices (which gives zero-dimensional arrays). If you are working with scalar quantities exclusively, it might be useful to clean up the resulting expression (e.g., use MacroTools to remove the []).\njulia> julia_expression(expval(a'()*a()*σx()))\n:(aᴴaσˣ[])\nBy default, two-level system operators are represented by the Pauli matrices σ^xyz, and calling σp() and σm() will give results expressed through them:\njulia> σp()\n1//2 σˣ() + 1//2i σʸ()\n\njulia> σm()\n1//2 σˣ() - 1//2i σʸ()\nThis can be changed by calling QuantumAlgebra.use_σpm(true; set_preference=true/false) (where the value of set_preference determines whether this is stored permanently using Preferences.jl). In this mode, σ^+ and σ^- are the \"fundamental\" operators, and all expressions are written in terms of them. Note that mixing conventions within the same expression is not supported, so it is suggested to set this flag once at the beginning of any calculation.\njulia> QuantumAlgebra.use_σpm(true)\n\njulia> σp()\nσ⁺()\n\njulia> σx()\nσ⁺() + σ⁻()\n\njulia> σz()\n-1 + 2 σ⁺() σ⁻()","category":"page"},{"location":"#Preferences","page":"Home","title":"Preferences","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Several preferences changing the behavior of QuantumAlgebra can be set permanently (this uses Preferences.jl):","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"\"define_default_ops\": if this is set to false (default is true), the \"default\" operators a, adag, f, fdag, σx, σy, σz, σp, σm are not defined upon import.
